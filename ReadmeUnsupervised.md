Need to Classify Clusters.
Got working of k-Means algo, got a little distracted by theory.
Now will be working on implementation, will try to form different clusters and try different inputs

k-means,
hmm,

Get K-means working!!!


To understand how to implement unsupervised learning, implement a sample example


Unsupervised Learning:
Given a data set, identify clusters.
To understand how things work, read scikit-learn documentation.
http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html

K-Means:

Affinity Propogation:
Sends messages between pairs of samples until convergence
